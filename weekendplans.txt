Ricky:
idk, I'm probably gonna go out during the weekend and do some yardwork. I kinda feel bad
for my housemates bc I lowkey broke the backyard door latch like a month ago I I still
haven't fixed it yet but hopefully it'll be done this weekend. Maybe I should get some
boba or something too. 

Kobe:
I have work this weekend, after that I'll just stay home after the first week back. I need to get started on my practicum proposal also.
